# TG-LSTM-network-for-time-series-prediction
 This paper will be presented in the form of an oral presentation at the IJCNN-2019 conference. The title is "Transformation-gated LSTM: efficient capture of short-term mutation dependencies for multivariate time series prediction tasks".
# Transformation gated file
You need to replace the original file with recurrent.py in the layers folder of keras-2.1.5!
